# ML Advertisement Click Prediction

### Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning algorithm for predicting whether a particular user will click on an advertisement. We will work with an advertising dataset from Kaggle, which you can find here:

### Dataset

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and contains information related to advertising campaigns. You can access the dataset here.

### Project Goal

Develop a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement.
Utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and visualize relationships between variables.
Train a regression model to make predictions and assess its accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, we will perform the following tasks:

Data preprocessing, cleaning, and handling missing values.
Statistical analysis and visualization to understand the dataset's characteristics.
Identify patterns, correlations, and trends among variables.
Create visualizations to better comprehend the data.

Model Training

In this phase, we will:

Preprocess the dataset for model training.
Select and implement a suitable machine learning algorithm.
Train the model using the prepared data.

We will assess the model's performance by:

Testing the trained model on a test dataset.
Evaluating its accuracy and other relevant metrics.
